While science, history, geography, art and design & technology follow this method, subjects like English, maths, computing, languages, music, PSHE, PE, and RE are taught separately, with relevant links made wherever possible.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Our curriculum also cultivates an awareness of life in modern Britain. Democracy thrives within our school, with avenues for pupil voice through the Junior Leadership Team and surveys. We reinforce the importance of laws through routines, assemblies and behaviour support, teaching children about their value, responsibilities, and consequences.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>In our safe and supportive environment, children are encouraged to make choices, exercise their rights, and develop cooking skills with a focus on healthy eating. Mutual respect is central to our ethos, evident in our mission statement and relationships across the school. Tolerance and understanding are promoted through exploring cultural diversity in various subjects and inviting contributions from different faiths or religions to enrich learning experiences.</p>",

From day one, students at The UCL Academy experience an inspirational world class education built on a culture of academic excellence, social responsibility and a transformational curriculum, developed in partnership with our sponsor, University College London.  Our students leave The Academy with the tools, experiences, values, knowledge and skills to reach their potential and take part as global citizens in the 21st century.   The Academy has been inspired by UCL\u2019s own Grand Challenges, which draw together research across disciplines at the university. While good grades matter, we believe that we must also develop students who are capable of critical thinking and problem solving. Our curriculum allows students to make connections between what they are learning and the real world and be better citizens who are more empathetic to world issues.<p><a href=\"https://uclacademy.co.uk/curriculum/gcse-curriculum/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"about__link\">Link to curriculum details</a></p>",

            "inclusivePracticeInfo": "<p>All students access the full curriculum offer, and are not restricted in the subjects they can choose at GCSE. Most teaching is in mixed attainment groupings with adaptive approaches - students learn both collaboratively and independently with targeted regular feedback and resources to ensure that they improve and progress.</p>\n\n<p>The school provides support for both students who are in the early stages of learning English, and those students who struggle with their literacy. More confident learners are pushed to achieve beyond their comfort zone across a range of curriculum areas as well as in their personal development and as young leaders.</p>\n\n<p>School leaders - staff and students - regularly review the curriculum to ensure that it is engaging, inclusive and reflects the diversity of our school community.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.williamellis.camden.sch.uk/about-us/policies-and-documents\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"about__link\">Link to inclusive practice policy</a></p>"
