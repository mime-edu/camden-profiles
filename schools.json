We focus on developing well-rounded learners by fostering creativity, curiosity, critical thinking, and care.</p><br>\n\n<p>Our curriculum includes enriching programs such as Forest School, Philosophy for Children, and an Artist in Residence, offering hands-on learning and creative expression. We also emphasize oracy skills, debate, and project-based learning to build confidence and communication. With a knowledge-rich and inclusive approach, we support all students, nurturing their unique strengths while fostering a love of learning. Through strong partnerships with external organizations, we broaden horizons and inspire aspirations, preparing children to be resilient, confident, and caring individuals ready for the future.</p><br>\n\n<p>In Maths, we use creative approaches such as problem-solving challenges, interactive games, and puzzles to deepen understanding. We incorporate real-world scenarios to make abstract concepts more relatable, fostering critical thinking and a love for problem-solving. Maths lessons often include collaborative group work, where students tackle tasks in dynamic, creative ways, encouraging peer learning and engagement.</p><br>\n\n<p>In English, we utilize a range of imaginative strategies, such as immersive storytelling, role-play, and drama to bring texts to life. Our literacy curriculum is enriched with creative writing tasks, debates, and class discussions. We also integrate visual arts and multimedia projects to support writing, allowing students to express ideas through different mediums and boosting their confidence as communicators.</p><br>\n\n<p>At Brookfield Primary, we use a knowledge-rich approach to the humanities that ensures children not only remember more but also engage deeply with the content. Our curriculum is carefully sequenced to build on prior knowledge, helping students make connections across topics and remember key facts and concepts. By focusing on a deep understanding of historical events, geographical concepts, and cultural studies, we encourage students to ask richer, more thoughtful questions. The use of engaging, immersive activities\u2014such as project-based learning, field trips, and role-play\u2014further excites children about their learning. This approach fosters curiosity, allowing students to explore topics in depth, think critically, and develop a genuine interest in the humanities. Through a structured yet stimulating curriculum, we ensure that every child not only retains knowledge but also sees the relevance and excitement in exploring the world around them.</p><br>\n\n<p>Our PSHE curriculum, along with assemblies and responsive planning, places children's well-being and personal development at the heart of our education. Through a carefully designed PSHE program, we focus on building emotional intelligence, resilience, and self-awareness, ensuring children develop a strong sense of identity and confidence. Our assemblies celebrate values such as kindness, empathy, and positive role models, reinforcing these messages. Philosophy for Children further enhances this by fostering abstract thinking, encouraging curiosity, and promoting empathy. By engaging with complex ideas and exploring different perspectives, children develop critical thinking skills and a deeper understanding of others. Responsive planning ensures that we adapt to the evolving needs of our students, offering support and challenges as needed. This holistic approach empowers children to take ownership of their learning, fostering confident, compassionate learners who believe in their ability to make a positive impact on the world.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.brookfield.camden.sch.uk/curriculum/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"about__link\">Link to curriculum details</a></p>",

		"curriculum": {
			"curriculumAim": "<p>At Gospel Oak, our curriculum embraces a topic-based approach to teaching several subjects, building connections between different areas of learning and deepening understanding. While science, history, geography, art and design & technology follow this method, subjects like English, maths, computing, languages, music, PSHE, PE, and RE are taught separately, with relevant links made wherever possible.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>Our curriculum also cultivates an awareness of life in modern Britain. Democracy thrives within our school, with avenues for pupil voice through the Junior Leadership Team and surveys. We reinforce the importance of laws through routines, assemblies and behaviour support, teaching children about their value, responsibilities, and consequences.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>In our safe and supportive environment, children are encouraged to make choices, exercise their rights, and develop cooking skills with a focus on healthy eating. Mutual respect is central to our ethos, evident in our mission statement and relationships across the school. Tolerance and understanding are promoted through exploring cultural diversity in various subjects and inviting contributions from different faiths or religions to enrich learning experiences.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The school's computing curriculum is a significant strength because it is comprehensive, inclusive, and forward-thinking. It equips children with essential digital literacy, coding, and problem-solving skills, ensuring they are confident, competent users of technology. The focus on safe and responsible use of technology helps develop a strong digital citizenship ethos. Integrating computing across subjects enhances engagement and supports wider learning goals. The school's approach, including regular assessments and home access to online learning platforms, ensures consistent progress monitoring and strong home-school connections, preparing pupils well for future academic and real-world challenges.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The music curriculum at Gospel Oak is a key strength due to its comprehensive, inclusive, and progressive approach. It provides children with opportunities to engage in high-quality music education, learn instruments, and participate in live music experiences. With specialist teaching and tailored support, all pupils, including those with SEND, can access and excel in music. The curriculum fosters creativity, self-expression, and ensemble skills, developing both individual and group musicianship. Regular performances and strong links with Camden Music enhance community involvement. The use of technology and varied assessment methods ensures ongoing progress and a rich, dynamic learning experience for all children.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The PE curriculum at Gospel Oak is a key strength due to its comprehensive and inclusive approach, which promotes both physical and mental well-being. It offers a wide range of activities that cater to diverse interests, from gymnastics and dance to competitive sports. The curriculum encourages children to develop essential skills, including teamwork, resilience, and sportsmanship while fostering a lifelong positive attitude toward physical activity. Specialist teaching and partnerships with local sports organisations enhance the quality of provision, and consistent assessment practices ensure that every child makes progress. The programme also strengthens community ties through events like sports fixtures and fun runs.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://sites.google.com/gospeloakschool.com/gospel-oak-primary-and-nursery/curriculum&ved=2ahUKEwjjxePjtJOKAxUdSUEAHYgoGtAQFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw13YWwQR0krBZbSliFJEeQw\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"about__link\">Link to curriculum details</a></p>",

Extensive career exposure, from Year 8 STEM days to Year 10 and 11 workplace visits, provides insights into diverse fields and roles, helping students make informed, appropriate decisions.</p>\n\n<p>In Years 11\u201313, our one-to-one careers guidance tailors support to each student\u2019s ambitions, ensuring they leave Haverstock fully prepared for their chosen path and equipped for long-term success.</p>"

			"curriculumAim": "<p>The aim of our curriculum is for pupils to have the requisite skills to be successful, independent, and motivated learners in readiness for their next stage of education. It is important that the curriculum considers the development of the whole child and not only concentrates on academic success. The curriculum at New End is designed to provide a broad and balanced education that meets the needs of all pupils and gives them the skills, knowledge, and understanding to prepare them for their next steps.</p>\n<br>\n<p>It ensures that academic success, creativity and problem solving, reliability, responsibility and resilience, as well as physical development, well-being, and mental health are key elements that support the development of the whole child and promote a positive attitude to learning. The curriculum celebrates the diversity of our community and utilises its skills, knowledge and cultural wealth while supporting the pupils\u2019 spiritual, moral, social and cultural development under the umbrella of British Values.</p>\n<br>\n<p>At New End we seek to offer wider enrichment opportunities for all children. We seek to be inclusive in our provision of enrichment activities within the classroom and in the information we offer to parents regarding opportunities beyond it. To enrich classroom learning, we try wherever possible to plan opportunities for visits and visitors. Class enrichment activities also include the involvement of every Year 5 child in The Shakespeare in Schools project each year; every child in Year 4 learning the recorder for the year; and the provision of a weekly chess lesson for every Year 2 and Year 3 child.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Specialist teachers and instructors support music, coding, physical education, French and chess. Theme weeks, whole school activities and opportunities within and outside school all enrich and develop the children\u2019s learning. After school clubs and events extend these opportunities further. The curriculum is both dynamic and adaptable, ensuring all children make progress from their various different starting points.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Children consistently achieve above national levels at the end of Key Stage 2. Excellent progress is made in reading, writing and mathematics. At New End we teach the computing curriculum in a unique way. This was recognised in our last OFSTED inspection and inspectors noted that our approach was worthy of being shared. Over ninety percent of the curriculum is covered through coding activities. As a result, children achieve beyond the expectations of the National Curriculum. There are also knock-on effects in other curriculum areas. For example, children are using negative numbers and angles earlier than expected. OFSTED stated that \"pupils' knowledge and expertise in computing are highly developed.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.newend.camden.sch.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"about__link\">Link to curriculum details</a></p>",

			"curriculumAim": "<p>The Robson House curriculum is divided into key areas, which together represent a holistic view of child development. We recognise the importance of teaching some skills sequentially and creating strong foundations for learning based on the key areas detailed on the roots and trunk of our learning tree. However, we view learning as a cyclical process where skills are being continually developed across all the key areas detailed below. In this way we are able to create highly individualised programmes of learning which carefully match the needs of each child and enable them to reach their full potential.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Due to the highly individual needs of the children in our care, we have designed a curriculum which is flexible enough to meet these needs but rigorous enough to reinforce the high expectations which we have for them. We place a great emphasis on creativity, with each class focusing on a specific topic each half term. Teachers have the freedom to respond to the interests and needs of their classes within a topic framework, which ensures that the curriculum is inspiring whilst remaining broad and ambitious.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Children access a wide range of subject areas and links are continually made between them to ensure that children can make connections and develop a greater depth of understanding. Learning is further enriched through an extensive programme of trips, expert visitors, immersion days/weeks and the celebration of special events and traditions. Children are given equal opportunity to take part in all aspects of school life and are encouraged to take ownership of their learning and the school environment in many ways, including through our School Council.</p>\n<br>\n<p>As many of our children arrive at Robson House with needs relating to their social, emotional or mental wellbeing we have structured our curriculum in a way that allows sufficient emphasis to be placed on these areas. All children benefit from a comprehensive programme of activities which prioritise their physical and emotional wellbeing such as daily fitness, Zones of Regulation work and Mindfulness sessions. This is further enhanced through integrated therapy and an in depth PSHE and Citizenship curriculum. Children are also given regular opportunities to develop their communication and language skills, as we recognise these are fundamental to the child being able to access the curriculum and maximise their learning opportunities. We believe that when children have a solid foundation in these core areas they are better able to develop their social and learning behaviours; removing previous limitations on their learning and empowering them to achieve their true potential.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.robsonhouse.org.uk/?page_id=602\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"about__link\">Link to curriculum details</a></p>",
