            "sendSupportInfo": "<p>We are committed to providing high-quality support for children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND). Our approach begins with quality first teaching, ensuring that all children receive an inclusive and differentiated curriculum tailored to their individual needs. Teachers use formative assessments regularly to identify gaps in learning and ensure immediate \"keep up\" support for all students, so no one is left behind.</p> \n<p>For children who require additional support, we offer targeted, personalised interventions in small groups or one-to-one settings, addressing specific areas of need. These interventions are designed to close learning gaps and provide focused support across the curriculum. Regular reviews and collaboration with parents and external specialists ensure that the support is continually adapted to meet the evolving needs of each child, fostering an inclusive environment where every child can thrive.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.argyle.camden.sch.uk/images/10.7_SEND__Policy_and_Information_Report__Sept_2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"about__link\">Link to SEND policy</a></p>",
            "inclusivePracticeInfo": "<p>At Argyle Primary School, we ensure inclusive practice through a whole-school ethos underpinned by our vision and values, which promote respect, equality, and diversity. This ethos is embedded in our teaching and learning practices, where we embrace adaptive teaching methods to meet the varied needs of all students. We utilise a range of groupings including mixed-ability groups which encourage collaboration and mutual support among children with different strengths and challenges. To further support inclusivity, we allocate additional adults where needed, ensuring that all children, especially those with SEND, receive the guidance and assistance necessary to succeed. We also make adjustments to the physical environment wherever possible, ensuring it is accessible and supportive of students' specific SEND needs, such as providing sensory spaces or alternative seating arrangements. By fostering an inclusive culture, we create an environment where every child feels valued, respected, and able to achieve their full potential.<p><p><a href=\"https://www.argyle.camden.sch.uk/page/?title=School+Policies&pid=13\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"about__link\">Link to inclusive practice policy</a></p>"

We want our children to broaden their horizons, understand what they could achieve and raise their aspirations for their future.\n\nThis enables our pupils to have a clear understanding of the link between achieving well at school and getting into an interesting job and career that is not bound by social mobility and gender stereotypes. Through the programme, children expand their knowledge and understanding of the world of work, the types of jobs there are and different career paths."
