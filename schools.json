To further support inclusivity, we allocate additional adults where needed, ensuring that all children, especially those with SEND, receive the guidance and assistance necessary to succeed. We also make adjustments to the physical environment wherever possible, ensuring it is accessible and supportive of students' specific SEND needs, such as providing sensory spaces or alternative seating arrangements. By fostering an inclusive culture, we create an environment where every child feels valued, respected, and able to achieve their full potential.<p><p><a href=\"https://www.argyle.camden.sch.uk/page/?title=School+Policies&pid=13\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"about__link\">Link to inclusive practice policy</a></p>"
